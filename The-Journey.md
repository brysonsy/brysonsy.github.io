## Growth

Throughout the semester I have had the amazing oppurtunity to learn about software engineering, and everything that comes with it. Through this semester, I gained the mindset of an athletic software engineer and grew as a student in computer science. With the semester soon coming to a close, I wanted to show the various skills that I have learned that will continue to aid me in my journey as a computer science major. 

## Addressing the Ethics

Ethics is one of the most important things that has to be considered, especially in the field of software engineering. With ethics being the morals principles that we should abide by as upstanding software engineers, it is extremely important that ethics and ethical conduct is followed. In the class we conducted case studies on a variety of different ethical dilemmas. The case study that I did was focused on the issue of privacy, which seems to be one of the most major concerns regarding the average consumer. If private information is shared the a users privacy is not handled with the ethicality that it should be handled with, there will be no future for communities of software engineers, since consumer trust will be broken. Thus, it is extremely important that there is ethics in software engineering to ensure ethic standards are met, especially with the ever increasing technological advancements that our society is constantly faced with.

Though ethics is not only limited to the field of software engineering, as ethics are extremely important in ones own life as well. Ethics should be considered in a person's own personal life as well, since not everything is black and white in this world, a person's morals will constantly be tested. Which is why ethics is so important, as eventually a person will have their own ethical standards that they will abide by, and as long as that person knows between right and wrong, they will without a doubt have a use for ethics in order to make the right ethical decisions.

## User Interface Frameworks

In class we were also introduced to a variety of different frameworks, such as Semantic UI and React. These frameworks allowed us to streamline the design process, and were amazing time savers. Since we were able to use the many features to create a sleek and modern website, while also being fully functional. Especially with our project's website, UH Waterfountains, we were able to create a sleek and functional rating system and a nav bar. With web design being a huge aspect that can easily take up a massive amount of time, by using the frameworks that we worked with in class we were able to efficiently and effectively create a flowing web page which was user friendly. If we did not have UI frameworks to work with, the amount of time used to even create one functional page would've been astonishing. Though it was difficult to get used to at first, with practice and time frameworks can be an amazing asset to any software engineer.

## Project Management

As a budding programmer, I haven't had the chance to work in many groups yet, with the biggest group I have worked in being three people including myself. So, when we were tasked with our final group project, it was a great oppurtunity for me to learn how to collaborate with other programmers. Having learned about Issue Driven Project Management, which is an Agile Project Management technique where issues are created and fixed as they arise. This method was a very useful one for our relatively small group consisting of five people, as it let us assign issues to ourselves as they came up and let each member handle issues on their own initiative. It kept what needed to be done organized, especially since we couldn't meet each other face to face. Though this method of project management isn't only useful in web application development, as I can see myself regularly using this management method while developing other software, like games.
