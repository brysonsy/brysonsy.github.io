## Growth

Throughout the semester I have had the amazing oppurtunity to learn about software engineering, and everything that comes with it. Through this semester, I gained the mindset of an athletic software engineer and grew as a student in computer science. With the semester soon coming to a close, I wanted to show the various skills that I have learned that will continue to aid me in my journey as a computer science major. 

## Addressing the Ethics

Ethics is one of the most important things that has to be considered, especially in the field of software engineering. With ethics being the morals principles that we should abide by as upstanding software engineers, it is extremely important that ethics and ethical conduct is followed. In the class we conducted case studies on a variety of different ethical dilemmas. The case study that I did was focused on the issue of privacy, which seems to be one of the most major concerns regarding the average consumer. If private information is shared the a users privacy is not handled with the ethicality that it should be handled with, there will be no future for communities of software engineers, since consumer trust will be broken. Thus, it is extremely important that there is ethics in software engineering to ensure ethic standards are met, especially with the ever increasing technological advancements that our society is constantly faced with.

Though ethics is not only limited to the field of software engineering, as ethics are extremely important in ones own life as well. Ethics should be considered in a person's own personal life as well, since not everything is black and white in this world, a person's morals will constantly be tested. Which is why ethics is so important, as eventually a person will have their own ethical standards that they will abide by, and as long as that person knows between right and wrong, they will without a doubt have a use for ethics in order to make the right ethical decisions.
