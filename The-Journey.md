## Growth

Throughout the semester I have had the amazing oppurtunity to learn about software engineering, and everything that comes with it. Through this semester, I gained the mindset of an athletic software engineer and grew as a student in computer science. With the semester soon coming to a close, I wanted to show the various skills that I have learned that will continue to aid me in my journey as a computer science major. 

## Addressing the Ethics

Ethics is one of the most important things that has to be considered, especially in the field of software engineering. With ethics being the morals principles that we should abide by as upstanding software engineers, it is extremely important that ethics and ethical conduct is followed. In the class we conducted case studies on a variety of different ethical dilemmas. The case study that I did was focused on the issue of privacy, which seems to be one of the most major concerns regarding the average consumer. If private information is shared the a users privacy is not handled with the ethicality that it should be handled with, there will be no future for communities of software engineers, since consumer trust will be broken. Thus, it is extremely important that there is ethics in software engineering to ensure ethic standards are met, especially with the ever increasing technological advancements that our society is constantly faced with.
