---

For our final project in ICS 314 I developed a website called UH Water Connoisseur with my group members Sean Sumida, Gunwook Baik, Jake Castillo, and Sheena Torres. UH Water Fountains is a web application designed so UH Manoa students will be able to rate the various water fountains on campus. My contribution to the project was the creation of the rating system and the directory page. Though, I also tried to help out on any other issues that my group members were having trouble with.
