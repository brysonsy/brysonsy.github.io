The hexadecimal sudoku solver shown here was a assignment from my ICS 211 class. This class dealt with implementing data structures in Java. For this assignment I had to use recursive algorithms which had just been introduced to us, and was personally one of the hardest projects given to us in the class.

For this project, I was tasked with creating a Java program which would recursively solve a hexadecimal sudoku puzzle.
