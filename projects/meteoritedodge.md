summary: The final group project of ICS 111.
---

Meteorite Dodge is a group project that I helped develop in ICS 111. This project's purpose was to create a program in Java using all the concepts and skills we learned over the semester. For this project our group decided to make a game where you would dodge moving objects that would hurt you and collect other moving objects which would increase your score.

For the project I was responsible for creating a character class which would control the movement of the player character. We also worked on the main class of the game as a group, creating a function which would keep a record of the highest score someone has achieved on the game screen. The project used many concepts we learned from the class which included, public and private member variables, member functions, and finite state machines.

Here is a demo of the project:
