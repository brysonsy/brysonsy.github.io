summary: A hurricane survival game made for ICS 111.
---

This hurricane survival game was the second project assigned to us in ICS 111. This was a game written in Java that also used the [EZ Library](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/). The goal of this game was to survive as long as possible while a hunger and water meter drained continuously. 

Here is a demo of the project:
