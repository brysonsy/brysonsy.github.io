## Learning Semantic

When I first started using UI Frameworks, or more specifically Semantic UI, it showed me how simple it can be to streamline the design process. Though it was frustrating when I first started using it, after all. having to learn the documentation and new syntax of the framework made it feel like a very complicated task. Though, once I started learning how to use the tools that Semantic UI provided for me, it made me realize just how much more streamlined it made the entire design process. 

Compared to only using standard HTML and CSS, using Semantic UI made the process of making a website so much more simple. While it can take hours to create a complex website with only HTML and CSS, while using UI Frameworks it can shorten that time dramatically. This is not only from the framework and coding tools that these UI Frameworks provide, but also from the knowledge and understanding that one gains from using these frameworks which allow a programmer to create a complex website efficiently and effectively.

## Modern Design

UI Frameworks also let programmers create sleek and modern UI components relatively easily. While it may take days, even weeks to create a modern looking website, UI Frameworks provide a variety of tools which allow programmers to create appealing websites. Unlike if they were using solely HTML and CSS to create website which can lead to it looking rigid and unappealing, and even if it a sleek and well designed website, the amount of time that must be put into it can lead to this method not being very viable.
