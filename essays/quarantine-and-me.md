## Daily Routine in Quarantine

Thankfully, I was always an introvert so Covid hasn't had an enormous impact on my daily routine. Though, with the transition to online classes I lose the chance to physically go to classes, which I do enjoy, as I definitely learn better when I am able to physically attend class. But with applications like Zoom, at the very least I am still able to connect and communicate with my teachers. Though with all the classes online now, I do find it harder to concentrate then when I am physically in class. Since now I have to independently learn without the guidance that is given in physical classes, and while teachers are still avaliable to speak with, I just find it harder to not procrastinate. I've also found that due to not being able to meet in class anymore, many of my discussion classes have assigned much more work in terms of writing on forums or video recordings to make up for this. And with my procrastination it leads to me spending much more time on school work then I did before.

Though because of Covid, I haven't really gone much at all ever since the university transitioned to online classes. With my restaurant job being on hold due to the order to shut down non essential businesses, I haven't been able to get a salary either. Also, since all the gyms were forced to close, I haven't been able to work out at all either, so I'm a bit worried about how my physical health will be after the quarantine is over. Also, while I have not been able to see my friends physically, I am luckily still able to communicate with them through applications like Discord, so not much has changed with my social life.

## The Impact

Though the impact that Covid has had on my life is undeniable. It has made me much more aware of my cleanliness and personal hygiene due to not wanting to infect my family members with anything. I have grandparents who have compromised immune systems, so I tend to worry a lot about accidently infecting them since the virus has such a long incubation period and the fact that I could still infect someone even if I don't have any symptoms is terrifying. It definitely has made me more stressed and worried about the well being of my family and friends, and I can tell that I do act differently around people who show indication of being sick. Since I have allergies as well, I get worried whenever I sneeze or cough, as testing isn't as widely avaliable as it should be at the moment.
