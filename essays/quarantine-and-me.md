## Daily Routine in Quarantine

Thankfully, I was always an introvert so Covid hasn't had an enormous impact on my daily routine. Though, with the transition to online classes I lose the chance to physically go to classes, which I do enjoy, as I definitely learn better when I am able to physically attend class. But with applications like Zoom, at the very least I am still able to connect and communicate with my teachers. Though with all the classes online now, I do find it harder to concentrate then when I am physically in class. Since now I have to independently learn without the guidance that is given in physical classes, and while teachers are still avaliable to speak with, I just find it harder to not procrastinate.
