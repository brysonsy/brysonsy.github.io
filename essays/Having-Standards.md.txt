## The First Impression Counts

To be completely honest, going through the setup of ESLint made me feel that it was tedious. Despite this I fully understand the reasons behind the use of such utilities. There are many different ways people write code, and sometimes code is not consistent and does not follow any coding standards. Looking at unorganized and messy code is definitely more frustrating than setting up the utilities needed to make sure code is formatted in line with coding standards. So while the initial frustration when setting up the ESLint made me wary of its utility, it became increasingly clear to me just how important it was.

## Meeting Standards

After taking a step back from the feeling of frustration I had when setting up ESLint, it is abundantly clear to me how useful ESLint and how important coding standards are for coding as a whole. While we may not like to admit it, we all make mistakes, this is especially clear when the thing that was causing a major issue in your code could be something as simple as a missing semicolon, or a misspelt variable. This is when ESLint comes into play, it gives people the ability to clean up their code and to establish a higher standard for themselves, and by establishing coding standards it makes it easier to remember to organize code and allows you to get rid of any bad habits you could have when coding. Coding standards are especially important when collaborating with others. By using coding standards other developers will be able to understand your code easier, which leads to less time spent on simply trying to understand messy and unorganized code and more time spent on actually working on the project that is being collaborated on. 

## A Green Checkmark for ESLint

Despite the inital annoyance I had with ESLint, I completely understand how useful it can and will be for my coding in the future. It makes it extremely easy for me to find errors I have made in my code, such as syntax errors. It also helps me understand the JavaScript syntax better, and it makes it so I don't have to look through all my code for an agonizing amount of time to find a single syntax error I foolishly made. Overall, it helps me keep a good coding standard so my code is organized and understandable to not only me but possible collaborators in the future. Though, I can also see myself rely on tools like these more than I should be, so while ESLint is an extremely convenient tool, I hope to not become solely dependent on it to fix my mistakes.
