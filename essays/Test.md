## First Impressions Count

One of the first programming languages I have ever learned was JavaScript in my STEM class at high school and in that class I learned how to use JavaScript. Throughout my time in that class I found JavaScript to be fascinating with me being amazed at the versatility of the language. Since I used JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS at the time I found what JavaScript brought to the table to be amazing. After experiencing Java, C, and C++ in my past ICS classes, coming back to JavaScript allows me to apply the knowledge I have gained from other programming languages to JavaScript. Compared to Java, I am definitely more comfortable with JavaScript and the flexibility it allows. While some see the idea of letting a variable being any data type as a bug, I prefer it due to the flexibility it gives me when I code with JavaScript. 

From a software engineering perspective I feel that JavaScript is a versitile and flexible language to work with. The simplicity compared to other languages is another reason why I personally love using JavaScript. Despite its supposed simplicity it is still a powerful tool for software development. Especially after learning the Syntax for ES6 through doing the FreeCodeCamp exercises given to us, it gave me a new perspective on how Java Script can be used.

## Becoming a Software Engineer Athlete

Athletic software engineering is a very interesting concept to me, and while I do agree that practice makes perfect, especially when it comes to programming, I can't help but have mixed feelings on it. While I do enjoy having the practice problems and WOD's as it allows me to practice the skills that I need to remember. It can be extremely stressful especially with the all or nothing grading system that WOD's have. Also the amount of work and practice that we have to do can pile up extremely quickly, especially if someone has a heavy course load already. So, this learning style has taken me a bit to adjust to.

For instance, when I attempted the ProjectEulerOne problem I blanked out and had no idea what to do. As I watched the timer I set slowly tick down to zero I could only panic, I hadn't even analyzed and broken down the problem fully before time had run out. Though I have improved since then, especially with the first WOD, as I was able to complete it fairly quickly and correctly I still can't help but be anxious with this new learning style. Though I am also excited with what this learning style might bring.
