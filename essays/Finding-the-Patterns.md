## The Beauty of Patterns

While people may think of patterns being solely about aesthetics and designs, that couldn't be farther from the truth. In software engineering design patterns are an essential part of the process for the success of projects. With design patterns providing a reusable solutions to a problem which occurs commonly in the context of software engineering. And with the use of these design patterns software engineers are able to create programs which are organized and efficient. Since, there are many issues in coding that are redundant, it is extremely beneficial to learn these design patterns in order to create elegant code, which is able to efficiently solve redundant and common problems which may occur.

Though there are many design patterns that software engineers can learn, and the sheer amount and versatility of design patterns can definitely be intimidating, with different classifications and entire lists of design patterns. It seems like a daunting task to learn a few, and learning all of them seems impossible. Though, by adapting a different mentality towards problems and actively using them, it becomes easy to develop a repertoire of these design patterns that you can actively use.

## Applying Knowledge

After looking at many of the design patterns that are available to software engineers, I realized that even in indroductory courses for computer science, I have been using design patterns in my programs. A major one that I have used would be singleton and factory patterns, which allowed me to have a level of efficiency that I wouldn't normally have had in my program. With the factory pattern allowing me to return objects associated with different classes and the singleton pattern which ensures that a class has one instance and providing a global point of access to that instance. 

## Overcoming Difficulties

With the difficulty only increasing as I continue down the path for my computer science major, it is imperative that I continue to expand my skill set for the upcoming challenges that I will have to face. Adding design patterns to my repertoire will undoubtedely create a variety of oppurtunities for me in the future.
