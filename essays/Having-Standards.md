## The First Impression Counts

To be completely honest, going through the setup of ESLint made me feel that it was tedious. Despite this I fully understand the reasons behind the use of such utilities. There are many different ways people write code, and sometimes code is not consistent and does not follow any coding standards. Looking at unorganized and messy code is definitely more frustrating than setting up the utilities needed to make sure code is formatted in line with coding standards. So while the initial frustration when setting up the ESLint made me wary of its utility, it became increasingly clear to me just how important it was.

## Meeting Standards

After taking a step back from the feeling of frustration I had when setting up ESLint, it is abundantly clear to me how useful ESLint and how important coding standards are for coding as a whole. While we may not like to admit it, we all make mistakes, this is especially clear when the thing that was causing a major issue in your code could be something as simple as a missing semicolon, or a misspelt variable.
