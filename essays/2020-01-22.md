## Starting Out

We all start from somewhere, for me it was when I chose a STEM class as an elective at my high school. This was where I had my first experience with programming, where I learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had always wanted a job that related to computers in some way as technology, especially computers, had always interested me since I was a kid. Though this class really opened my eyes to the world of programming. Eventually I graduated from high school and enrolled as a student at the University of Hawaii. When the time came to pick my major, I didn't have many doubts about what I wanted to do in the future and chose to major in Computer Science.
