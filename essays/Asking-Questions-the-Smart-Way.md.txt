## What is a Smart Question?

Questions are extremely important for the learning process, they are the foundation which can lead to a better understanding of a concept or the creation of new ideas which will pave the way forward for others. We are taught that there are no such thing as a stupid question, this is so students will actively engage in discussion and the class. But what if someone asks a question that is irrelevant to the material being learned or if someone asks about something basic which they should know in a advanced class? So in order for meaningful progress to be made towards the learning process it is very important that smart questions are used effectively. 

A smart question is a question asked after the subject has been researched thoroughly and all other options have been exhausted. Smart questions should contain specific information about problem you are having and the attempts and steps taken to solve this problem so far. Since time and what we use our time for is important to all of us, using smart questions is essential to a software engineers tool kit as it lowers the time needed to craft an adequate answer to the question provided. Also, if the question is crafted well, other developers will be more likely to answer it, as their understanding of the problem will be better then if it were not a smart question.

## A Smart Question

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5767325/how-do-i-remove-a-particular-element-from-an-array-in-javascript) is an example of a smart question, which can be found on StackOverflow. It is a user asking about how to remove a particular element from an array in JavaScript. He talks about having an array of numbers and how he is looking for the equivalent of something like: 
```
array.remove(number);
```

This question is concise and specific, with the author immediately giving an explanation on what he is attempting to do. He gave information on what he wanted and gave an example of an equivalent of what kind of solution he was looking for. The straightforward nature of the question then led to specific answers that detailed ways to solve the problem, with the problem in this case being on how to remove a particular element from an array in JavaScript. I was able to generate discussion about the multiple ways to remove an element from an array in JavaScript and was answered easily due to the specificness of the question.

## A Question that is not as Smart

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43120543/convert-given-time-into-millisecond) is an example of a question that is not as smart. The user simply asks how to convert given time into milliseconds and gives a time format they are using. No further explanation is given and no example code is shown either.

Though the title of the question is somewhat adequate for identifying the problem the user is having, the question itself is another story. It is brief, not concise like the smart question that was shown before. It has a single sentence with the user asking how to convert given time into milliseconds. It is quite obvious that the user did no research of their question before posting it, which is shown by the short and vague question the user asked. Thus, the question was met by equally curt responses with users directing the original poster to links and other resources. Though the question was eventually answered it was also flagged for being to broad.

## A Learning Experience

After looking at multiple questions that can be classified as both "smart" and "un-smart" questions I now have a better idea and understanding of how to structure and create smarter questions. Before this experience I have always been unsure and apprehensive about asking my professors for help. Though now that I have a better understanding of how to create questions that are smarter I am confident in my ability to ask smart questions consistently. Even if I have to practice the creation of smart questions, that to is a learning experience which will overall help me in not only my college career, but also any future endeavors I wish to undertake.
