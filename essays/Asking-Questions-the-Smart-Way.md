## What is a Smart Question?

Questions are extremely important for the learning process, they are the foundation which can lead to a better understanding of a concept or the creation of new ideas which will pave the way forward for others. We are taught that there are no such thing as a stupid question, this is so students will actively engage in discussion and the class. But what if someone asks a question that is irrelevant to the material being learned or if someone asks about something basic which they should know in a advanced class? So in order for meaningful progress to be made towards the learning process it is very important that smart questions are used effectively. 

A smart question is a question asked after the subject has been researched thoroughly and all other options have been exhausted. Smart questions should contain specific information about problem you are having and the attempts and steps taken to solve this problem so far. Since time and what we use our time for is important to all of us, using smart questions is essential to a software engineers tool kit as it lowers the time needed to craft an adequate answer to the question provided.
