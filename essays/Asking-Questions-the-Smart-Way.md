## What is a Smart Question?

Questions are extremely important for the learning process, they are the foundation which can lead to a better understanding of a concept or the creation of new ideas which will pave the way forward for others. We are taught that there are no such thing as a stupid question, this is so students will actively engage in discussion and the class. But what if someone asks a question that is irrelevant to the material being learned or if someone asks about something basic which they should know in a advanced class? So in order for meaningful progress to be made towards the learning process it is very important that smart questions are used effectively. 

A smart question is a question asked after the subject has been researched thoroughly and all other options have been exhausted.
