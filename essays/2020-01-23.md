## First Impressions Count

One of the first programming languages I have ever learned was JavaScript in my STEM class at high school and in that class I learned how to use JavaScript. Throughout my time in that class I found JavaScript to be fascinating with me being amazed at the versatility of the language. Since I used JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS at the time I found what JavaScript brought to the table to be amazing. After experiencing Java, C, and C++ in my past ICS classes, coming back to JavaScript allows me to apply the knowledge I have gained from other programming languages to JavaScript. Compared to Java, I am definitely more comfortable with JavaScript and the flexibility it allows. While some see the idea of letting a variable being any data type as a bug, I prefer it due to the flexibility it gives me when I code with JavaScript.
